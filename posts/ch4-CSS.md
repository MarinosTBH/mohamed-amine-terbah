CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside **HTML** and **JavaScript**.

How is CSS used?

CSS is used to **control the appearance of web pages**. It can be used to change the **font**, **color**, **size**, and **layout** of text, as well as the appearance of **images**, **tables**, and other elements on a web page. CSS can also be used to create complex layouts and **animations**.

Types of CSS :

There are two main types of CSS: **internal** and **external**.

CSS is embedded within the HTML document, while external CSS is stored in a separate file.
