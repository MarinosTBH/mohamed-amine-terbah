**Web development** is the process of creating websites and web applications for the **internet**. It involves a variety of skills, including web design, programming, and database management. Web developers use a range of programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, **JavaScript**, and PHP, to build websites and web applications that are interactive, responsive, and dynamic.

The web development process typically involves several stages, including **planning**, **design**, **development**, **testing**, and **deployment**. During the planning stage, developers work with clients to identify their requirements and goals for the website or application. In the design stage, they create the visual layout and user interface for the site or app. Development involves building the site or app using programming languages and frameworks, while testing ensures that everything works as intended. Finally, deployment involves making the site or app live and accessible to users.

Web development can be divided into two main categories: **front-end** development and **back-end** development. Front-end developers focus on the user-facing aspects of a website or application, such as the design, layout, and interactivity. They use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, dynamic interfaces that users can interact with. Back-end developers, on the other hand, focus on the server-side aspects of a website or application, such as database management, server configuration, and API development. They use programming languages such as PHP, Python, and Ruby to create the functionality and infrastructure that powers the site or app.

In recent years, web development has become more complex and diverse, with the advent of new technologies and **frameworks** such as React, Angular, Vue, and Node.js. These tools enable developers to create sophisticated, scalable web applications that can handle large amounts of data and traffic.

Overall, web development is a vital part of the digital landscape, enabling businesses and organizations to create engaging, interactive online experiences for their audiences.
