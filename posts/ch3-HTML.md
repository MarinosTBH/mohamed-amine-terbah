HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating the structure and presentation of web pages. It provides a set of tags that define the elements and content of a web page. Here is a brief presentation of HTML and some of the most famous tags along with their definitions:

**`<html>` :** 
It represents the root element of an HTML document and contains all other elements.

**`<head>`  :**
This tag is used to define the head section of an HTML document. It contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, CSS stylesheets, and scripts.

**`<title>` :**
It defines the title of the HTML document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

**`<body>` :**
This tag encloses the main content of the web page, including text, images, links, and other HTML elements.

**`<h1>` :** to **`<h6>` :**
 These tags define headings of different levels, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> being the lowest.

**`<p>` :** It represents a paragraph of text.

**`<a>` :** This tag creates a hyperlink and is used to define a link to another web page or a specific location within the same page.

**`<img>` :** It is used to embed an image into the web page. It requires a source attribute (src) to specify the image URL.

**`<ul>` :** and **`<li>` :** These tags are used to create unordered lists. <ul> represents an unordered (bulleted) list, and <li> defines individual list items.

**`<ol>` :** and **`<li>` :**: Similar to <ul> and <li>, these tags create ordered (numbered) lists.

**`<div>` :** It is a container tag used to group and style other HTML elements together.

**`<span>` :** This tag is an inline container used for grouping and applying styles to small portions of text within a larger block of content.

**`<table>` :** It defines a tabular structure with rows and columns, used for presenting data in a structured format.

**`<form>` :** This tag is used to create an interactive form on a web page. It contains input fields, checkboxes, buttons, and other form elements.

**`<h1>` :** It creates an input field within a form, allowing users to enter data.

These are just a few examples of HTML tags. HTML provides a wide range of tags to structure and present content on the web.
