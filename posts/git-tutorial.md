**Git** is a **version control system** that allows you to keep track of **changes** in your code over time. It's like a **time machine** for your code! With Git, you can collaborate with others, experiment with new features without worrying about **breaking things**, and easily roll back to a **previous version** if something goes wrong.

**GitHub** is a web-based platform that uses Git to host and manage your code repositories. It's a place where you can share your code with others, collaborate on projects, and contribute to open source software. GitHub has become the go-to platform for many developers and companies, with a thriving community of users and a wide range of tools and features.

**GitLab** is another web-based platform that uses Git, similar to GitHub, but with a different focus. While GitHub is more geared towards hosting public open source projects, GitLab offers a broader range of features, including the ability to host private repositories, continuous integration and deployment, and more.

Whether you choose **GitHub or GitLab**, or another platform altogether, the most important thing is to use version control in your development workflow. It may take some time to learn, but once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it!
